## Inspiration

Working remotely can be challenging, especially amidst a worldwide pandemic that knocks everyone off balance. 
Identifying a way to avoid an overwhelming schedule while coping with pressure from either work or school is crucial to our mental health as well as physical health. While the worldâ€™s entertainment industry booms in the past year, we realize that people are actively seeking ways to unwind meanwhile leveraging various relaxation outlets to cater to their intricate relationship with life. 
There are many platforms that help form habits now, but from a behavioral psychology point of view, I wondered if they were really contributing to habit formation. 
In games, quests are rewarded through external factors, even for minor actions, but in reality, consistent efforts are required to form habits and a lot of internal motivation are required. 

So I thought that if we could make real life like a game, many people in the world would be able to form habits more pleasantly. After analyzing the current applications that target productivity, we decide to integrate a fun game that allows users to keep their own cats while keeping track of their time using the famous Pomodoro technique. This Application is MVP Model Now, And we will adopt Blockchain(NFT, Tokenomics) and AR technology soon.

## What it does

Based on the Pomodoro Technique, our application offers a customizable way for users to set their own working sessions. Users can choose the duration of their short work sessions to optimize labor division of their intended tasks. Users are also given the option to customize the duration of their short and long breaks as well as the number of working cycles before commencing a long break. The number of cat coins is calculated based on the accumulated amount of time that the users spend on their work. In a separate view where users keep track of their cats, cat coins are used as currency to customize the background and decorations for the cat. Moreover, we support cat coin booster features that allow the users to earn extra cat coins within a limited time frame compared to normal users. By earning cat coins during work sessions in the application, users are given the option to purchase decorations for their cats, which serves as a positive reinforcement that helps release the pressure of completing arduous tasks. As users purchase decorations for their cats, the happiness index for the cat would increase. The highest threshold of the happiness index is at 100.
